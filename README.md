# 01. Setting
Before making video, You have to define `Video's resolution`, `Frame per second(FPS)`, `Color Space`.

**_`Video resolution🎬`_**
- ♡ 3840x2160 4K UHD ♡: High resolution. required high device spec.
- 2560x1440 2K QHD: mostly used for gaming videos.
- 1920x1080 FHD: general resolution. but recently, trend is to use 4K.

**_`Shorts resolution📱`_**
- ☆1080x1920☆: Close to cell phone resolution. mostly use.
- 2160x3840: mostly used for Fan Camera.


**_`FPS🎞`_**
- 24: movie
- 30: generally used.
- ♥60♥: recommended. high quality, but more capacity.
- 120: premature. Best quality, but unsupported on Platform


**_`Color Space🖼`_**
- Rec. 709 8bit
- ♥Rec. 709 10bit♥
- HLG (HDR 8bit)
- ★PQ (HDR 10bit)★
- P3 D65 HLG: very high efficientcy. but too premature.
- (*🎨8bit can express 256^3 color but 10Bit can express 1024^3 color.)

# 02. Clips
Clips include main subtitles, main video, main image.
Non-important clips should be less than 5 secs! **_(*tip: Cut out silent scenes or sections you don't need)_**

**_Keyframe preset_**
- `3 secs or less:`
0:00: Vis 0 / 0:45: Vis 100 / end-0:15 (ex: 2:45 ): Vis 100 / end (ex: 3:00): Vis 0

- `Over 3 secs:`
0:00: Vis 0 / 1:00 Vis 100 / end-0:30 (ex: 3:30 ): Vis 100 / end (ex: 4:00): Vis 0

You can add other effect such as zooming, rotating, animating while vis(visibility) changes.
If you template them, your work will be accelerate🔥🔥🔥
When you add short memes like 'Tralalero tralala', You don't need to add these effect.

![image](https://github.com/AHMUMAL/mmu_badasemi/blob/main/assets/Subtitle%20Design.png)

**_`text`_** 

Select the font type (see reference) and adjust the size of the font size.
Select font type (see above) and adjust font size according to mood.(60pt for 1080p, 120pt for 4K)
You can also use highlighting effects such as bold or italic. 
You can also change font alignment according to situations.

**_`color`_** 

Change the color of the letter itself.

**_`line`_** 

Change the color of the edges of the letters. Adjust the thickness so that the colors of the letters are not covered!!

**_`background`_**

As you can see in the picture, a box that appears behind the handwriting. Adjust the color, transparency, etc. according to the situation.

**_`shadow`_** 

creates a three-dimensional effect by giving a slight angle and distance. 
It has various effects, such as placing it at the bottom to give a shading effect, or matching it with the border color to make the character shine.



## 02-2. Sound/Visual Effect (SFX, VFX)

The `Sound/Visual effect (FX)` can be said to be very important not only increases the fun of videos but also leads viewers to focus. 
In general, it is an essential element for video editing, 
but you will think a lot about how to start at first, and how to get them.
For those of you who are new to video editing, I am sharing the link to the FX organization drive I have collected since 2019.

**_Transition_** 

It's the conversion effect of a video clip. It makes the video very natural and smooth. From simply turning, blurring, or turning over the screen, to the movie effect, the lens effect, the cross effect, and so on.
